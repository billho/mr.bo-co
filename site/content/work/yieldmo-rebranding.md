  overview: "Branding, is as much a science as an art. When done right, every visual and verbal choice is informed and made with intention and purpose. This is a rebranding effort that goes much deeper than tweaking a company's identity or message. It is designed to tell the full story–ranging from the Yieldmo's founding principles to its future potential. The goal is to evoke specific reactions from core constituents: potential clients, investors, media and recruits."

## the challenge

By 2017, Yieldmo has been around for 5 years and earned applaudable recognition within the ad tech industry. Moreover, Yieldmo is on the path to proving the true power of engagement—all the nuanced micro-interactions between humans and their phones that Yieldmo alone measures.

The challenge is not to redefine who Yieldmo is, but rather to reinforce the brand so the company's mission and core values are communciated in an unequivocal manner. Additionally, all of these components should be "living" and will continue to evolve in line with the company's products, performance and in-market experience.

## the research

In this project, Design and Marketing worked together closely to conducted thorough research that spanned 6 months. The rigorious process involved multiple workshops, interviews, and field studies. Everyone in the company was invited to participate in that process via surveys, brainstorms, and many one-on-ones.

Inspired by [Simon Sinek](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)'s work, one of the branding exercises employed the "Why" and "How" framework that pushes participants to think deep about the company's mission.

The team also complied in-depth brand marketing research, including key insights.

## core values

The team have identified 5 adjectives that define how Yieldmo wants itself to be perceived, all of which are reflected in its visual/verbal representation: 

- Transformative
- Proven
- Trustworthy
- Tenacious
- Human-centric

## the story

After all the diligent groundwork, at this point the story was already on the horizon. It didn't take long to form a coherent and powerful narrative.

The story is called "Truth."

This represents a new visual and verbal articulation for Yieldmo. This serves as the source of inspiration to combat the villain in the Yieldmo story -- which has been identified as "ignorance." That is, marketers' ignorance caused by insufficient insight into campaigns and ultimately, their customers.

## design patterns

To support the story and more importantly, the core principles underpin it. We created several design patterns as visual metaphors. 

These patterns are derived from the simplest shapes: waves, dots, spotlights, and lines. Yet with creative combinations and motions, they expressively reflect the brand identity and are used concertedly throughout all aspects of the branding execution: website, posters, and peripheral goods.
