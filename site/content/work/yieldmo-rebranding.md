## design patterns

the dramatic swerves as shown here can imply volatility and/or a downhill trajectory. The thin lines in our "Insights Current" design are intended to appear in multiples, alluding to the massive, energetic data set we're working with here - the reduction in number and this particular application make them lose their purpose.

## recommendation

Dear Admissions Officer:

I am pleased to write to you in support of Ms. Yuan Feng for her application to your
graduate program.

Ms. Yuan Feng impressed me with her research attitude and design craft. I came to know
Ms. Yuan when she was furthering her design study in Canopy Institute of Design, 
where I served as a mentor. During this time, she independently worked on a project that
spanned User Research, Prototyping, Visual Design, and Usability Testing. The project's goal was
to design a mobile app concept that would better the process of managing diets for upcoming moms 
during their pregnancy. Needless to say, the subject matter is a real-world problem that requires 
diligence, patience, and ingenuity.

At the outset of the project, I advised her to refrain from rushing to visual design until 
quality research has been done. Taking this into careful consideration, Ms. Yuan conducted thorough 
research which included detailed interviews, competitive analysis and
user journy mapping. I was pleasantly surprised by the variety of research methods and moreover, the 
depth of understanding that went into those efforts. Ms. Yuan went even further to tweak the research
findings in multiple rounds. The improvements she made in each step of the research could be evidently 
felt. Eventually the fine-tuned problem statement and research insights accurately grasped the pain points 
of users and set a solid foundation for the rest of the design process. Considering her relative lack of 
practical experiences, the research she did was truly excellent.

In terms of her hands-on design skills, Ms. Yuan's work can be best described as delicate and creative. 
Throughout the project she produced voluminous sketches, wireframes and hi-fidelity mockups. It is not 
hard to notice her solid fundamentals when it comes to sketching and drawing. For instance, to better illustrate
the user journey, she hand-crafted multiple storyboards in which key interactions and touchpoints are vividly
captured. Further along the process, Ms. Yuan turned to digital tools such as Sketch and Adobe Creative Suite
and the results were equally thoughtful and enjoyable. It's worthnothing that she managed to not get mired in
visual tweaks. I informed Ms. Yuan that it is critical to establish a visual design language and maintain a 
systematic-level thinking. She took the advice keenly and as you may find in her portfolio, the project 
pertaining to this letter demonstrates great potential for consistent and scalable design.

Besides her strong dedication to research and craftsmanship. Ms. Yuan possesses a lovely and
caring personality, and it was a pleasure to know and mentor her. Undoubtedly, she has my firm support in
her quest to your academic program. Please take this recommendation into account when considering her
application and feel free to contact me should you require further information about her.
