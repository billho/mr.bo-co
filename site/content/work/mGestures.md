## challenge
 
How might we utilize native mobile interactioin patterns? - (Stack, Shadowbox). For example, shake, tap, tilt and swipe.

## storyboard

Creating storyborads help us clarify intention and better understand the gestures in appropriate context.

Here is shake:

Here is tap and hold:

## identify key gestures

Among all the gestures we explored during the research phase, the following two represents the most prevalent use cases:

- Swipe: do not mention Stack yet, just say working on a solution that copes well with this gesture.
- Tilt: same as above. It works by detecting the device gyroscope motion and animates in response, creating a new opprotunity to engage users.

## ui iteration

we went through many iterations as to the look and feel for the UI.

## interaction design

<div><img src="/work/mgestures/stack-interaction-1.gif"></div>
<div><img src="/work/mgestures/stack-interaction-2.gif"></div>

## outcome

Stack: A swipeable stack of cards that conveys brand message, fun and captivating to interact with.

Shadowbox: Give your ad creative depth with the Shadowbox format. Mobile sensors offer new ways to make your message stand out. Shadowbox uses the mobile accelerometer to create delightful animation as the phone tilts in the reader's hand.

- Reader scrolls shadowbox format into view
- Visual cue to tilt device start to animate
- Reader tilts the device, interacting with the format
- Format comes out of view and back
- When at rest, visual cue reappears
