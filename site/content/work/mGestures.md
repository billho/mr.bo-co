  overview: Smartphone is not only the most personal device, but may also be the most versatile device as well. The portability of mobile affords a suite of interactions that are not applicable to previous generations of digital devices. Swipe, scroll, tap, long touch, shake.. the list goes on and on. This project took a closer look at the treasure trove of interactions and distilled delightful interaction patterns that conform to Yieldmo's design language.

## challenge

Since the original iPhone release in June 2007, the standard vocabulary of gestures on mobile has been expanding. Gestures solve a lot of UI problem by maximizing the real estate of the screen. However, it also presents a lot of usability problems related to discover and learn. How might we utilize these native mobile interactioin patterns without hurting the user experience?

The mGestures projects aims to extract interaction design patterns from the commons gestures, such as shake, tap, tilt and swipe. The deliverables will tap into the rich world of mobile gestures and try to provide answers that balance business goals and design sensibilities.

## storytelling

The team employed compelling usage of Personas, User-Journeys, and other storytelling frameworks to clarify design intentions. For example, the storyboards below were instrumental in helping us understanding hand gestures under certain circumstances.

Here is shake:

Here is tap and hold:

## identify key gestures

Among all the gestures we explored during the research phase, the following two represents the most prevalent use cases:

- Swipe: while ubiquitous in carousel, swiping is also a popular choice in a large number of mobile UI patterns. This gesture is usually used to unpack a sequence of information centering around a common theme. The advent of touch screen provides the perfect medium for such gesture.

- Tilt: tilting is one of the most unique gestures that is almost analogous to portability. It works by detecting the device gyroscope motion and animates in response, creating a new opprotunity to engage users. To tilt may seem trivial, but the very gesture implies something very intentional.


## ui iteration

We create style guides, templates, and other accelerant frameworks for the design team members

We went through many iterations as to the look and feel for the UI.

## interaction design

After building physical prototypes and conducting contextual analyses. We fine-tuned a selected group of interactions specifically design for the two key gestures.

- **Swipe**: this interaction works by combining the popular "card" design concept and the "drag-and-drop" interaction pattern.

</div>

- **Tilt**: this interaction uses a featured brand image which consists of "safe area" and "shadow area". Once user tilts the phone in a certain direction the corresponding "shadow area" will be revealed, providing a sense of delightfulness and serendipity.

## outcome

To consolidate the findings, we developed two accompanying formats that focuses on "Swipe" and "Tilt" respectively.

Stack: Give mobile advertising creative depth plus playfulness. This format features a swipeable stack of cards that conveys brand message, which is fun and captivating to interact with.

Shadowbox: Mobile sensors offer new ways to make messages stand out. Shadowbox uses the mobile accelerometer to create delightful animation as the phone tilts in the reader's hand. Below illustrates the complete interactions that take place within this format. 

- Reader scrolls shadowbox format into view
- Visual cue to tilt device start to animate
- Reader tilts the device, interacting with the format
- Format comes out of view and back
- When at rest, visual cue reappears

## patent

One of our inventions, the Stack format, has been granted design patent for its innovative exploration of touch device and swiping gesture.
