You'll utilize industry design standards and best practices to define and implement design criteria, you'll apply user centered design methodologies to ensure your ideas are based on customer needs, and you'll prepare research and testing, produce personas, map customer journeys, develop service blueprints, for complex products and services."

"Additionally, you'll effectively communicate research findings, conceptual ideas, detailed design, and design rationale both verbally and visually, you'll use a variety of methods to convey ideas and concepts (e.g. storyboards, wireframes, prototypes, etc), you'll use your narration and storytelling skills to bring product ideas to life, and you'll construct quick interactive prototypes with initial, low fidelity visual designs that illustrate your UX/UI design that present a realistic feel of the intended experience. Further, you'll be expected to perform task analysis and define the User Interface Design through information architecture, wireframes and user flows and validate it through usability testing, to lead usability testing sessions, consolidate findings and iteratively integrate into design solutions, and to mentor others and capability build to cultivate and support them through their path at McKinsey."
