1)Inspire DV leadership and multi-disciplinary team members with clear communication, hands-on contribution, and strong advocacy for best practices in Experience Design throughout all venture phases

7）Create style guides, templates, and other accelerant frameworks for the design team members

8）Create unique products and culturally-relevant solutions to engage users with valuable experiences
9）Consider the moments of engagement, or touch-points, between people and brands, as well as the ideas, emotions and memories these moments create
10）Implement a cross-discipline perspective that considers multiple aspects of the brand/business/experience and creates a way for businesses to align with design to solve problems
11）Translate strategic design into controls, mechanisms and processes that users require to meet goals
12）Communicate the product’s vision to partners and customers to test and explore venture opportunities
13）Develop artifacts or images to make opportunities tangible for multiple audiences
14）Identify and collect exemplars and articulate their design logic, benefits and tradeoffs
15）Participate in visual problem-solving with the Strategic Designers, Venture Architects and Product Managers
16）Develop lists of prioritized concepts, wireframes, annotations and UX mapping
17）Create design briefs that outline design iterations, prioritized concepts and timelines
18）Develop choices around design and user interfaces that allow cross-discipline teams to solve customer pain points and challenges
19）Develop initial, low fidelity visual designs for prototypes, as well as information and content strategy that includes graphical representations of quantitative data or other information elements
20）Perform wireframe iterations based on feedback from internal reviews and user testing
21）Construct quick interactive prototypes that illustrate your UX/UI design: functional with modern effects, animations, and transitions as appropriate, that present a realistic feel of the intended experience
22）A bachelor’s degree, preferably in interaction design, HCI, or another relevant design field
23）Mastery of Sketch, Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and emergent UX tools
24）Expertise in building interactive prototypes to illustrate your own UX & UI design for web sites and mobile apps using modern technologies: from quick prototyping tools such as InVision/Flinto to more detailed prototyping with Origami/Quartz, Xcode, or tools with similar depth

For Lead Designer: 5+ years of experience in a start-up environment and exposure to cross-discipline teams, preferably having been a startup founder or in a lead/senior hands-on position designing user experience from conception to minimum viable products to large scale launch & adoption
A background working directly with developers for the implementation of designs


Templates:

Deliver a UX vision, along with a plan for evolutionary, iterative updates, that develop the larger vision over time.

"In this role, you will need to apply conceptual thinking to create desirable and feasible digital solutions across multiple platforms, smartly bringing together user needs, business goals and technical realities.  You'll utilize industry design standards and best practices to define and implement design criteria, you'll apply user centered design methodologies to ensure your ideas are based on customer needs, and you'll prepare research and testing, produce personas, map customer journeys, develop service blueprints, for complex products and services."

"Additionally, you'll effectively communicate research findings, conceptual ideas, detailed design, and design rationale both verbally and visually, you'll use a variety of methods to convey ideas and concepts (e.g. storyboards, wireframes, prototypes, etc), you'll use your narration and storytelling skills to bring product ideas to life, and you'll construct quick interactive prototypes with initial, low fidelity visual designs that illustrate your UX/UI design that present a realistic feel of the intended experience. Further, you'll be expected to perform task analysis and define the User Interface Design through information architecture, wireframes and user flows and validate it through usability testing, to lead usability testing sessions, consolidate findings and iteratively integrate into design solutions, and to mentor others and capability build to cultivate and support them through their path at McKinsey."

Create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes to communicate ideas at various stages of development
