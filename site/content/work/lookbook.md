## challenge

Many brands have aspirational images of their products being used for their catalogs or websites. How might we leverage these assets to create a "shoppable" experience?

## storyboard

Advocate for users in a fast-paced environment, imparting day-to-day design leadership that fosters a shared understanding of the user-centric intersection between design, content, business and engineering.

Lookbook is a result from the [mCommerce Research](/work/mobile-commerce-research/)

## userflow and wireframe 

The role will help to shape teams and the way we work. Weâ€™re looking for design managers who are excited to localize our product for the Chinese audience, build new products for the market and help Chinese travelers explore the world through our local experiences, personable hosts, and unique accommodations.

That email thread about this research


## a/b test

- Idea 1: Format is coming into view, hotspots are already on there, pulsating. Hotspots continue to pulsate as user continues to scroll.
- Idea 2: Format is coming into vivew, but there are no hotspots. As user continutes to scroll, the hotspots are intruduced and pulsating.

## future iteration

Since we designed initial Lookbook concepts, there has been validation of this type of experience with [Instagram shoppable ads](http://www.adweek.com/digital/retailers-can-now-make-instagram-posts-much-more-shoppable/) and [Pinterest](https://blog.pinterest.com/en/search-outside-box-new-pinterest-visual-discovery-tools), so it is worth developing further iterations that is distinct in Yieldmo's design language.

We also designed two concepts for future iteration.
