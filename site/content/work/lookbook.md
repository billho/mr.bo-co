## challenge

Many brands have aspirational images of their products being used for their catalogs or websites. How might we leverage these assets to create a "shoppable" experience?

## storyboard

Advocate for users in a fast-paced environment, imparting day-to-day design leadership that fosters a shared understanding of the user-centric intersection between design, content, business and engineering.

Lookbook is a result from the [mCommerce Research](/work/mobile-commerce-research/)

## userflow and wireframe 

The role will help to shape teams and the way we work. We're looking for design managers who are excited to localize our product for the Chinese audience, build new products for the market and help Chinese travelers explore the world through our local experiences, personable hosts, and unique accommodations.

## amazon mechanical turk

The team conducted a [comsumer research](https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/LookbookMTurkPreview) using Amazon Mechanical Turk to understand a few aspects of the product:

- Hot-spot recognition and usage
- Expected brand favorability and in-store visit intent

<div><img src="/_images/work/lookbook/mturk-1.jpg"></div>

The research provided qualitative data to understand consumer behavior on a large scale (259 U.S.-based respondents). It was highly valuable in informing design iterations and a/b testing directions. 

## a/b testing

Combined with the insights from MTurk, the team also run numberous A/B tests to better understand user engagement from a quantativie perspective. The example below illustrates 2 ideas regarding "in-view" interaction.

- Idea 1: Format is coming into view, hotspots are already on there, pulsating. Hotspots continue to pulsate as user continues to scroll.
- Idea 2: Format is coming into view, but there are no hotspots. As user continutes to scroll, the hotspots are intruduced and pulsating.

## future iteration

Since we designed initial Lookbook concepts, there has been validation of this type of experience with [Instagram shoppable ads](http://www.adweek.com/digital/retailers-can-now-make-instagram-posts-much-more-shoppable/) and [Pinterest](https://blog.pinterest.com/en/search-outside-box-new-pinterest-visual-discovery-tools), so it is worth developing further iterations that is distinct in Yieldmo's design language.

We also designed two concepts for future iteration.
