overview: Uber began six years ago as a way for 100 friends in San Francisco to get luxury rides — everyone’s private driver. Today, we’re a transportation network spanning 450 cities in 72 countries. That network delivers food and packages as well as people, all at the push of a button.

## the challenge

Uber’s original premise was simple: “Push a button, get a ride.” You didn’t need to set your destination, you didn’t need to select a product, you just hit a button or two and you were off.

Simple shopping cart implementation wasn’t the answer for this brand, as the high level of product customization and 13 different collections needing commercialization required a different approach.

## ideation

We began by making a precise 3D model of the pier. This allowed us to form our designs around the existing physical structure and test how installations would fit in real-time while allowing the structural engineer to assess feasibility.

Obtaining life insurance has always been an important step to help protect a family’s financial future, yet often the application process can seem time-consuming and complex. After interviewing families in Houston and across the country, MassMutual, one of the largest life insurance companies, discovered that a significant number of people thought life insurance was important, but that the application process was too complicated and they couldn’t afford it.

## prototype

To ensure that our designs were structurally sound, we relied on 3D printing and CNC methods to make models that we tested before mass fabricating. We rented a small warehouse in Burlingame where we could create prototypes quickly.
