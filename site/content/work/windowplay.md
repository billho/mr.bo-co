overview: Windowplay packs a powerful brand punch. Give your vertical, horizontal, or square video assets the added bonus of complementary brand imagery and CTA overlay. The surrounding brand imagery is revealed bit by bit as customers scroll the page, creating the simulation of an image "behind" the page. This eye-catching effect increases engagement with advertising campaign, making sure the brand leaves a lasting impression.

## the challenge

The Yieldmo design team have seen impressive success with their [window](https://formats.yieldmo.com/#/demo/window) format, which leverages position-aware technology to simulate an image "behind" the page a user is on. 

As video continues to gain remarkable growth on mobile, it's inevitably intriguing to ask: how might we apply that proven design principle to a much richer medium?

## ideation

We began by digging deeper about following two questions: 

* What makes the window format so successful? 
* What makes a video experience successful?

After several interviews and contextual inquiry sessions, it became clear that the secret sauce lies in Yieldmo's proprietary "scroll-to-reveal" interaction pattern. Such interactions provide a native way to break out of an in-content ad unit’s confined real estate without resorting to obnoxious pop-ups or fullscreen takeovers.

When it comes to consuming video on mobile, one key principle is to minimize disruption. Specifically, that means:

1. Play video inline by default. 
2. Give user the option to have finer control over the progress of the video.
3. Expand to full screen only if initiated by user.

## user flows

The design team went great length in exploring various factors that could affect a enjoyable Windowplay experience. Such factors include network connection, inline vs. full-screen transition, window view animation and brand overlay effect. 

The interplay of aforementioned factors made it possible for highly complex user flows. We made sure all critical user scenarios are accounted for.

## versatility

Windowplay is designed to accommodate videos with a wide range of aspect ratios.

It works great on all kinds of brand verticals. Here are three examples from airline, TV series, and consumer goods, respectively.

## iteration & outcome

In its first shipped version, our A/B tests showed significant uplift in both engagement and conversion compared to standard outstream video format:

We also designed [Hyperplay](https://formats.yieldmo.com/#/demo/hyperplay), an alternative mobile video format based on the same design principle. Here's the result for an early iteration of the Hyperplay format:
