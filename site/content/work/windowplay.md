overview: Uber began six years ago as a way for 100 friends in San Francisco to get luxury rides — everyone’s private driver. Today, we’re a transportation network spanning 450 cities in 72 countries. That network delivers food and packages as well as people, all at the push of a button.

  <p>Uber’s original premise was simple: “Push a button, get a ride.” You didn’t need to set your destination, you didn’t need to select a product, you just hit a button or two and you were off.</p>
