## the challenge

Consumers are spending more and more time on mobile not to just consume content, but also engage in activities that may lead to a final purchase. However, the journey is not simply "click-and-go", the role that mobile plays is far more evasive, yet most mobile advertising still centers around that simple mindset. 

The Yieldmo Design Team setted out to identify different phases for consumers to make a purchase on mobile. The goal is to understand how users are consuming content on mobile, and how that leads to browsing product information and therefore inform purchase decisions.

## interviews

We conducted in-depth user interviews with 5 participants. Specifically, we were interested in learning their routines on mobile, how various touch points affect certain behaviors which may ultimately lead up to a meaningful action in the purchasing funnel.

- "Subway commute is when I red articles a lot."
- "Lots of mobile web. Using Facebook and Twitter as pointers to mobile web pages."
- "From thinking about buying it to actually singning up for HBO Now, it was about a month-long proecss."
- "I don't use bookmarks. I email myself a lot of things, articles I want to read later."
- "Saw ad for Slack and already knew about it before that, so was like 'alright, let me try it.'"
- "Retargeting is like a nudge to get it done"
- "Motivated, but there's a couple things preventing you from pulling the trigger"
- "When you know what you're going to buy, then buying on mobile is extremely convenient."

## user journey

Based on the raw data from interivews. We went through multiple sessions of in-depth analysis around different journeys users go through. Realizing their stories varies from individual perspectives and experiences, we made deliberate efforts to uncover the converging themes and common patterns.

## behavior map

Visualizing user attitudes and behaviors in a behavior map helps the design teams align on a deep understanding of end users. We formulated an complete behavior map that is comprised of three stages:

- Discover: the actions involve view, expand, and involve.
- Evaluate: the actions involve compare, refine, and specify.
- Purchase: the actions involve consider and purchase.

## synthesis

We also documented the process and translated some ideas to forms that are easier to comprehend. Below you will find detailed summaries to our user interviews. In addition to that, there are also the synthesis about our framework and associated insights.

## uncover patterns

Another important objective of the project is to uncover prevailing design patterns and surface components that are best suited for mobile. We run thorough Competitive Analysis of major online shopping outlets such as Amazon, eBay, as well as trending mobile-centric brands. We also examined other factors such as ergonomics and cognitive cost.

## ui components

Below you can find some of the UI components we designed and developed in the project. The may contain multiple layers of interaction, in which case we also introduced complete user flows.

## interaction design

Even in a research-centric project, we spend a lot of time explore the role of delightful interactions in affecting users behaviors and their mobile commerce journey.

The result of this project the is theoritical fundation and design infrastructure of many upcoming ad formats that are purposefully designed for mobile commrce.
