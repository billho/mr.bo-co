## the challenge

Identify different phases for consumers to make a purchase on mobile.

We are trying to understand how users are consuming content on mobile, and how that leads to browsing product information and therefore inform purchase decisions.

## interviews

We conducted in-depth user interviews with 5 participants. Specifically, we were interested in learning their routines on mobile, how various touch points affect certain behaviors which may ultimately lead up to a meaningful action in the purchasing funnel.

- "Subway commute is when I red articles a lot."
- "Lots of mobile web. Using Facebook and Twitter as pointers to mobile web pages."
- "From thinking about buying it to actually singning up for HBO Now, it was about a month-long proecss."
- "I don't use bookmarks. I email myself a lot of things, articles I want to read later."
- "Saw ad for Slack and already knew about it before that, so was like 'alright, let me try it.'"
- "Retargeting is like a nudge to get it done"
- "Motivated, but there's a couple things preventing you from pulling the trigger"
- "When you know what you're going to buy, then buying on mobile is extremely convenient."
